# Suicide Ideation Detection
This project aims to detect suicidal ideation from Twitter data using Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and BERT-based approaches. It explores various methodologies to classify tweets as suicidal or non-suicidal, with the goal of contributing to mental health awareness and intervention efforts.

The project is divided into three main components:
1. **Machine Learning Models**
2. **Deep Learning Models**
3. **BERT-Based Models**

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle: [Suicidal Tweet Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aunanya875/suicidal-tweet-detection-dataset). This dataset has been internally generated by our team members specifically for our NLP project. This dataset contains labeled tweets, making it suitable for binary classification tasks.

### Key Features of the Dataset:
- Textual content of tweets
- Labels indicating suicidal or non-suicidal intent

## Methodology
### 1. Machine Learning Models
- Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- Preprocessing: Text cleaning, Tokenization, and TF-IDF vectorization
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

### 2. Deep Learning Models
- Architectures: LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU
- Preprocessing: Tokenization and embedding using pre-trained word vectors (e.g., GloVe)
- Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras

### 3. BERT-Based Models
- Pretrained Model: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- Fine-tuning: Adapting BERT for the binary classification task
- Framework: Hugging Face Transformers library
